# calcQT
Calculator UI in PyQt5, without functionality. This repo was created for education, but if you need smth from here for whatever reason, feel free to use this code of course with limitations of MIT License.

But if you got here by accident, may be consider looking to my bigger projects like [binarian](https://github.com/farkon00/binarian) and [clisd.py](https://github.com/farkon00/clisd.py).
